# Python

In these so called "feynman techniqued note files" I will try to explain subjects, concepts, and much more in a very simple language that a 6 year old will be able to understand what is going on. Simple as in both it will be very elementary in english since it is not my native langage and simple because that is how the feynman technique works. Plus, since most of the programming concepts are extremly abstract I will try to give example analgoies from the real world, so that the reader will have easy time grasping the idea.

So with the neccessary greetings out of the way, let's look at what concept we are going to look at today; "PYTHON" is the name of it ... Basically we are going to learn what programming languages are and how compiled vs. interpreted programming languages differ from each other. Don't wory about the technical jargon yet, I will simplyfy all of them as we go along. And once those little concepts above are explained we can easily dive deep into what python is, how can we use python to write very good computer programs or just learn it for the fun of it.
