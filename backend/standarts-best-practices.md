## Standarts and Best Practices

So what are standarts and best practices? As you can imagine, it is pretty fucking self-explainatory. While we code or create any kind of software we need standarts so that the work we produce is not bad. You can think of it like food production. If the company does not follow the rules and standarts the food they produce wont even hit the shelves because the government and licesing agencies wont let them. However, that is not the case with software engineering. Even though we like our standarts there is no one to empose them on a small/medium or even large programs.

You might think that we shouldn't be this fanatic about standarts when it comes to software since it is just abstract right? What happens when an aircraft or an electric car crashes just because of badly written code? You see, abstract becomes physical real quick. That is why we should always stick to best practices and standarts that are set out by the community of the people we trust and respect.
